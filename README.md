# Project: TV Advertising Sales Prediction using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)  

## Overview
This project aims to explore the relationship between TV advertising budgets and sales using the k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) regression technique. By applying kNN, we can understand how varying values of TV advertising budgets impact sales, visualize the model predictions, and analyze the accuracy of the kNN approach in capturing this relationship.

## Purpose
The primary objective of this project is to apply kNN regression to the Advertising.csv dataset to predict sales based on TV advertising budgets. We aim to demonstrate the effect of different values of k (the number of nearest neighbors) on the modelâ€™s predictions and performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the Advertising.csv file. It contains information on TV advertising budgets and corresponding sales data collected from a set of observations.

## Columns in the dataset:
- TV: TV advertising budget (in thousands of dollars)
- Radio: Radio advertising budget (in thousands of dollars)
- Newspaper: Newspaper advertising budget (in thousands of dollars)
- Sales: Sales (in thousands of dollars)
